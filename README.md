# SkypeChatStats

**This script is very old and probably stopped working a long time ago. It is obsolete and unmaintained, provided here only for historical interest.**

A Python script to talk with Skype API to show top chatters in a chat for a given period.

Jaanus Kase, <http://www.jaanuskase.com>

## How to get started

1. Get the skypeChatStats.py script.
1. Install the dependencies: [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) for templates and [dateutil.parser](http://labix.org/python-dateutil) for date parsing. Both are also available through [pip.](http://pip.openplans.org/)
1. It also needs Skype4Py, bundled here.
1. Run the script with the right parameters.
1. Look at the results. :)

The right way to run the script is something like this:

    skypeChatStats.py -s "start-date" -e "end-date" -c "chat-name"

For example:

    skypeChatStats.py -s "2010-01-01" -e "2010-04-01" -c "#example/$8947847abcd"

You can get the chat name in any Skype chat if you enter the message "/showname" (without quotes) and you get a magic response with the name.

## Misc notes

The latest Skype4Py version is hard to find. [The files are here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/skype4py/files/) but there’s no "homepage" to speak of. So I bundled it just in case.

The script crashes on Mac. It looks like latest Skype4Py, Python and Skype do not get along and Python crashes spectacularly (I haven’t seen Python crash before, yay.) It works OK on Windows, but to make things more fun, Windows terminals may not render Unicode correctly, so if you use UTF-8 in your templates, be prepared for fun.
